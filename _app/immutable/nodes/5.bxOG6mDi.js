The Quest:</h2> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6"><li>The game revolves around quests: tasks to find and rediscover important sites in Melbourne.</li> <li>These sites could be landmarks, historical buildings, parks, statues, or monuments—places that represent Melbourne’s rich heritage.</li></ul> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Hints from a Mysterious Guardian:</h2> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6"><li>At the start of each quest, the player receives a starting hint from a mysterious guardian of the city. This figure, who seems to know Melbourne’s hidden secrets, guides the player through cryptic clues.</li> <li>The player must rely on their local knowledge to navigate the city and identify the location.</li> <li>If the player struggles, they can request up to 3 additional hints from the guardian, each progressively revealing more details about the location.</li> <li>Using hints comes at a cost: For every hint used, the player loses points, so there’s an incentive to solve the quests with minimal help.</li></ul> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Uploading Site Descriptions:</h2> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6"><li>Once the player successfully navigates to a location, they must upload a description of the site, including its significance, history, and location details.</li> <li>These descriptions help others rediscover Melbourne and serve as the foundation for rebuilding the city’s digital presence.</li></ul> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Scoring System:</h2> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6"><li>Points are awarded for each location discovered and successfully documented.</li> <li>Scores decrease when hints are used, encouraging players to rely on their own knowledge and intuition.</li></ul> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Impact on Melbourne:</h2> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6"><li>The player’s goal is to restore Melbourne’s prominence, both digitally and physically.</li> <li>By rediscovering and documenting these locations, players are helping the city become vibrant again, attracting tourists and bringing life back to Melbourne’s streets.</li> <li>The more quests players complete, the more Melbourne thrives, ultimately restoring its status as a dynamic cultural hub.</li></ul>';return{c(){e=o("div"),e.innerHTML=i,this.h()},l(t){e=r(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),c(e)!=="svelte-evqdfz"&&(e.innerHTML=i),this.h()},h(){h(e,"class","container mx-auto p-6 bg-gray-100 text-gray-800")},m(t,a){d(t,e,a)},p:s,i:s,o:s,d(t){t&&u(e)}}}class f extends m{constructor(e){super(),g(this,e,null,p,n,{})}}export{f as component};
